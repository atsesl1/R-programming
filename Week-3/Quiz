## Question 1
## Take a look at the 'iris' dataset that comes with R. The data can be loaded with the code:
library(datasets)
data(iris)
## A description of the dataset can be found by running
?iris
## There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. In this dataset, what is the mean 
## of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica? (Please only enter the numeric result and nothing else.)

# Solution:

tapply(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Species,mean)


#here is an alternative solution:

Library(datasets)
data(iris)
  x <- subset(iris,Species=="virginica",select=1)
   #or  x <- iris[which(iris$Species=="virginica"),1)
   
    mean(x)
  
## Question 4
## Continuing with the 'mtcars' dataset from the previous Question, 
## what is the absolute difference between the average horsepower of 4-cylinder cars and 
## the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars?

## Solution:
x <- subset(mtcars, cyl==4, select=hp)
y <- subset(mtcars, cyl==8, select=hp)
z <- abs(mean(x$hp)-mean(y$hp))
print(z)
